I'd want to use a remote repository to share my work with other people and allow me to access the repository from other computers.

Forks are specific to github and allow me to copy a whole repository on github from someone else and edit it independantly of the original. Cloning is copying the repository to my local computer or vice versa and branching is branching into a different set of commits.
